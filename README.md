# Project Overview: Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a supervised machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on various medical features.

## Workflow:
### Data Understanding

Load and analyze the dataset.

Identify key features related to CKD.

Understand missing values and data distributions.

### Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values.

Normalize or scale numerical features.

Encode categorical variables.

### Feature Engineering & Selection
Identify the most important features influencing CKD prediction.

Apply feature encoding and transformation techniques.

### Model Selection & Training
#### Train multiple supervised classification models:
Logistic Regression (LR),

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),

Naive Bayes (NB),

Support Vector Machine (SVM),

Decision Tree (DT),

Random Forest (RF),

Extra Trees (ET),

AdaBoost (AB),

Gradient Boosting (GB),

XGBoost (XGB)
Compare model performances.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize model parameters for better accuracy.

### Evaluation & Results
Compare accuracy scores and other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Identify the best-performing model for CKD prediction.

### Key Findings:
The Extra Trees Classifier (ETC) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) achieved 100% accuracy on the dataset.

Decision Tree (DT) also performed well but with slightly lower accuracy.

The dataset likely has strong patterns, allowing tree-based models to excel.

### Next Steps & Improvements:
Validate the model on an unseen dataset to check for overfitting.

Use feature importance analysis to interpret which medical parameters are most critical.

Deploy the best-performing model as a web or mobile app for CKD risk prediction.
